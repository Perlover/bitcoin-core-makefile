    * Update LND - current master branch

2019-03-05
    + Added the mainnet-lnd-debug-start & testnet-lnd-debug-start commands.
    * Updated the README.md for a debug lnd mode

2019-02-20
    * Added commands (bash functions): loc & ltoc - an openning channel with node of format pubkey@host:port
      The format: loc <pubkey@host:port> <amount_satoshi>
      This commands (loc - mainnet, ltoc - testnet) connect and open channel (because native lncli commands don't understand same format...)
      Before an openning this command will check do we have already a channel with them or not. If yes the channel will not be opened.
